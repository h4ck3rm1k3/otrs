_Description: Should the database user name be reset to otrs?
 You have configured ident authentication, which is recommended, together
 with a database username that is not the default 'otrs'. That will only
 work with special hand crafted PostgreSQL setups. It is recommended to
 reset the username to 'otrs'. If you do not choose this option and the
 installation fails you should consult the file
 /usr/share/doc/otrs2/README.Debian.
Default: true
