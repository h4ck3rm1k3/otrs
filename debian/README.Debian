------------------------------
This is an experimental version of the debian packaging.

Initial password and location:
------------------------------

After you have finished the setup, you will find your otrs2 under this URL:
	http://localhost/otrs/index.pl

The initial username is: root@localhost
The initial password is: root

Please change this after you have logged in!


OTRS package manager:
---------------------

otrs2 includes by default a package manager. This will not work with the Debian
package, because to have it work, we need to relax too many file permissions.

Also have a look here:
	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=475737

But if you are aware of the security issues and you realy need the integrated
package manager, then execute the following:
	/usr/share/otrs/bin/otrs.SetPermissions.pl --otrs-user=otrs --otrs-group=www-data --web-user=www-data --web-group=www-data /usr/share/otrs/
	/usr/share/otrs/bin/otrs.SetPermissions.pl --otrs-user=otrs --otrs-group=www-data --web-user=www-data --web-group=www-data /var/lib/otrs/

Notes from the previous package maintainer:
-------------------------------------------

Please read http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=drm3kmx_0cbr3x9 first!

Thank you.


The setup of the database is now handled by dbconfig-common. It supports
currently postgresql and mysql. If you are using other database types you have
to choose 'No' when asked if you want to us dbconfig-common and you have to
setup the database yourself. The files in /usr/share/otrs/scripts/database/ and
/usr/share/otrs/scripts/ might be helpful. They contain schemas, schema updates
and initial inserts.

I have removed most of the description how to setup the database manually. If
you want to do it manually and don't know how to start, please use tools like
pgadmin3 or mysql-navigator, respectively.

The following SQL statement might be useful for postgresql (if your db is
called 'otrs2') to give apache access to your db:

  grant all on database otrs2 to "www-data";

If you have done something wrong, you can always call

  dpkg-reconfigure otrs2

again.

otrs will be installed into /usr/share/otrs instead of the upstream
/opt/otrs to conform to Debian policy.

Cron jobs are automatically installed into /etc/cron.d/. The otrs user will be
created automatically. Please edit /etc/otrs/Kernel/Config.pm if necessary to
have reasonable defaults.
