otrs (2.0.4p01-13) unstable; urgency=low

  The cron jobs are now handled by the init script /etc/init.d/otrs2. The
  content of the files /etc/cron.d/otrs_* will be moved to /etc/otrs/cron
  before the files are renamed to /etc/cron.d/otrs_*.dpkg-old when upgrading
  from older package versions. You may remove those backup files.

  There is now some online documentation at
  http://www.writely.com/View.aspx?docid=drm3kmx_0cbr3x9 and it is recommended
  to read it.

otrs (2.0.4p01-11) unstable; urgency=low

  The otrs2 package now uses dbconfig-common which enables automatic database
  setup, upgrades and removal. Currently dbconfig-common only supports
  postgresql and mysql. If you are using a different database type you should
  answer 'No' to the question if you want to use dbconfig-common and you must
  setup your database manually.

  The package now has an init script which can set OTRS in maintenance.html mode
  when 'stopped'. You can adjust /etc/otrs/maintenance.html to you local
  needs.

otrs (2.0.4p01-4) unstable; urgency=low

  The file backup.pl and restore.pl have been restored. It mainly follows this
  algorithm:

  backup.pl
  1. store every link file to a seperate tar-archive
  2. store the archives with tar --dereference (short: -h) to store the actual
  content of the files

  restore.pl
  1. restores SymLink.tar.gz into a temp-directory
  2. takes all symlink-information from theses symlinks and moves the files to
  the original destination-directory (which need to be empty, at least
  concerning the copied files)
  3. sets the symlinks as they were in the first place

otrs (2.0.4p01-3) unstable; urgency=low

  The files backup.pl and restore.pl have been moved to the directory
  /usr/share/doc/examples/ because otrs is _not_ a general purpose backup tool.
  If you want to use those examples to backup your OTRS installation you have
  to change them for yourself to suit your needs. Patches for the scripts are
  welcome of course.

otrs (2.0.4p01-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Note that OTRS version 2 has changed the database schema and you should read
  /usr/share/doc/otrs/UPGRADING and /usr/share/doc/otrs/README.Debian.
