2.4.0 beta1 (2009/04/20)
 - (2009/04/20) Changed default config size of IPC-Log (LogSystemCacheSize)
    to 32k (64k is not working on darwin).
 - (2009/04/20) Moved from bin/SetPermissions.sh to bin/SetPermissions.pl
    for a better maintanance.
 - (2009/04/20) Added warning screen to AdminSysConfig, AdminPackageManager,
    AdminGenericAgent to block to use it till SecureMode is activated.
 - (2009/04/18) Added SysConfig setting to (not) include custmers email address
    on composing an answer "Ticket::Frontend::ComposeAddCustomerAddress".
    Default is set to true.
 - (2009/04/17) Added own SysConfig settings for bulk action (
    Ticket // Frontend::Agent::Ticket::ViewBulk).
 - (2009/04/15) Removed AgentCanBeCustomer option from agent frontend.
    Customer followup messages can only be created from the customer frontend.
 - (2009/04/09) Added search for article create times in ticket search.
 - (2009/04/09) Improved email send functionality to properly format emails
    with alternative parts and inline images.
 - (2009/04/09) Added enhancement bug# 3514 - RegExp support in ACLs. Now you
    can use RegExp in ACLs like the followin example:

    $Self->{TicketAcl}->{'ACL-Name-1'} = {
       # match properties
       Properties => {
           Queue => {
               Name => ['[RegExp]^Misc'],
           },
       },
       # return possible options (white list)
       Possible => {
           # possible ticket options (white list)
           Ticket => {
               Service  => ['[RegExp]^t1', '[RegExp]^t2'],
               Priority => [ '4 high' ],
           },
       },
    };

    Starting with "[RegExp]" in value area means the following will be a regexp
    content.

    This ACL will match all Queues with starting "Misc" and all services with
    starting "t1" and "t2". So you do not longer need to write every full queue
    names to the array list.

    o Usage of [RegExp] results in case-sensitive matching.
    o Usage of [regexp] results in case-insensitive matching.

 - (2009/04/08) Updated CPAN module CGI to version 3.43.

    parts of REMOTE_USER or HTTP_REMOTE_USER by using a regexp. Example to
    strip @example.com of login.

    [Kernel/Config.pm]

    # In case you need to replace some part of the REMOTE_USER, you can

    So the database customer is now improved to set all database attributes
    in CustomerUser config. For example this is the solution to prevent
    the sybase error message:

    $Self->{CustomerUser} = {
        Name   => 'Database Backend',
        Module => 'Kernel::System::CustomerUser::DB',
        Params => {
            DSN       => 'DBI:sybase:yourdsn',
            User      => 'some_user',
            Password  => 'some_password',
            Table     => 'customer_user',
            Attribute => {},
        },

    API Example (old):
        $CacheObject->Set(
            Key   => 'SomeKey',
            Value => 'Some Value',

    and webserver user (often incoming emails are shown some times again).
    TicketStorageModule in Kernel/Config.pm.
     * Kernel::System::Ticket::ArticleStorageDB -> (default)

    needs more memory.

    (e. g. Kernel/Language/bg.pm). Updated docu.
 - (2002/11/21) moved var/cron/* to var/cron/*.dist (.dist is not used) to make
    updates easier! Thanks to Bryan Fullerton!
 - (2002/11/15) moved %doc/install/* to /opt/OpenTRS/install in RPM-specs.

 - (2002/11/11) added new config file as Kernel/Config.pm.dist (will be used
    for >= OTRS 5.0 Beta9) if you want to test it with 0.5, use Kernel/Config.pm.dist
    as Kernel/Config.pm (cp Kernel/Config.pm.dist Kernel/Config.pm)!
    Kernel/Config/Defaults.pm is the config file with all defaults. If you want
    to change this settings, add the needed entry to Kernel/Config.pm(.dist)
    and the Kernel/Config/Defaults.pm will be overwrite. Updates will be much
    easier! - http://lists.otrs.org/pipermail/otrs/2002-October/000315.html

    If the client browser disabled html cookies, otrs will work as usual, append
    SessionID to links! (Kernel/Config.pm --> $Self->{SessionUseCookie})

     * "Kernel::System::Ticket::Number::AutoIncrement" (default) --> auto increment
        ticket numbers "SystemID.Counter" like 1010138 and 1010139.

        "Year.Month.Day.SystemID.Counter" like 200206231010138 and 200206231010139.
     * "Kernel::System::Ticket::Number::DateChecksum" --> ticket numbers with date and
        check sum and the counter will be rotated daily like 2002070110101520 and 2002070110101535.
     * "Kernel::System::Ticket::Number::Random" --> random ticket numbers "SystemID.Random"
