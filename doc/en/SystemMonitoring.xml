        <title>Preface</title>
        <para>This module implements a basic interface to System Monitoring Suites. It
    works by receiving email messages sent by a Network Monitoring Suite. New
    tickets are created in case of component failures. Once a ticket has
    been opened messages regarding the effected component are attached to
    this ticket. When the component recovers, the ticket state can be
    changed or the ticket can be closed.
</para>
        <para>If an open ticket for a given Host/Service combination exists, all
    mails concerning this particular combination will be attached to the
    ticket until it's closed.
</para>
        <para>Please contact your commercial support (support@otrs.com) if you have any queries regarding this document or need further information.</para>

        <title>Control flow</title>
        <para>The following diagram illustrates how mails are handled by this module
    and in which cases they trigger which action. Pretty much all checks are
    configurable using the regular expressions given by the parameters listed
    above.

<para>Besides of a few additional sanity checks this is how the
    SystemMonitoring module treats incoming mails. By changing the regular
    expressions it should be possible to adopt it to different monitoring
    systems.

            <para>Only mails matching this "From:" address will be considered for this

            <para>New status for ticket when service recovers. This can be either
        "OLD" in which case the old status stays, or the name of the new
        status. Please note, that this state needs to be configured in your
        OTRS installation as valid state. If the state you set here does not
        exist, the ticket state will not be altered.</para>

            <para>Pending time in seconds for 'Pending...' statuses. (Ignored for
        other status types). Please note that this setting will be ignored
        by OTRS versions older than 2.2. On these systems the pending time
        already associated with the ticket will be used, which may have in
        surprising effects. It's recommended not to use 'Pending...' states
        with OTRS prior to 2.2.</para>

            <title>Integration with OTRS Configuration Management</title>
            <para>If the OTRS::ITSM Configuration Management module is installed and
    the configuration option 'SystemMonitoring::SetIncidentState' is set
    to 'Yes', a CI with the given host name is searched in the CI database.
    If exactly one CI with this name was found, the current incident state is set
    automatically according to the incoming mail (Incident / Operational).

    If the OTRS::ITSM Configuration Management module is installed and
    the configuration option 'SystemMonitoring::LinkTicketWithCI' is set
    to 'Yes', a CI is linked automatically with the system monitoring
    incident ticket. This is only possible if a subsequent system monitoring
    email arrives!
